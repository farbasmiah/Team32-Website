					<p>
						Over the course of COMP204P, we have spent time understanding all the aspects of the web app so we knew exactly what was required. In doing so, we have 
						produced three initial prototypes for the user interface based on our own interpretations of the requirements and user needs.
					</p>
					<p>
						After producing the three proposed user interface designs, user evaluations were performed on each of them to identify potential issues and strong points.
						This then proved useful as we were able to merge the ideas into a single, final prototype for the UI. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Target users: 
					</p>
					<p>
						Skilled hospital workers. It is expected they shall be competent in using computers and new technology. Examples include Doctors and medical 
						machine operators. The application will most likely only be used in hospitals or where the MRI brain scan has taken place. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Potential problems:
						<li>An internet connection is required which might not be available for the user</li>
						<li>Scans uploaded might not be of the correct file format required to generate a prediction</li>
						<li>Server side could become overloaded from large numbers of requests, leading to very long wait times</li>
					</p>
					<p>
						The three initial prototypes are shown below (click to enlarge images):

					<h4>

					</h4>
					<p>
						For this prototype we have seen the design is very simple which makes it easy to follow the instructions for each step. However, there are some clear 
						issues that would make the prototype not very user friendly. Although the navigation going through each step is fine, there needs to be a way of going 
						backwards. There should also be some chance of multitasking by allowing multiple scans to be processed at the same time as well as saving the results 
						online.

					<h4>

					</h4>
					<p>
						This prototype contains the ideal pages for the website. The page that allows the user to view an overview of all their scans is a very useful feature. 
						However, it could be very tedious for a user to request multiple scans when each one requires large amounts of compulsory data to be filled in. There 
						should also be an option to print out or save the data locally.

					</p>
					<h4>
						Conclusions
					</h4>
					<p>
						This prototype is similar to the first one with a very simple user interface and very little ambiguity. It has sections for compulsory and 
						optional data which could prove useful for a scan with limited data. However, it is only possible to carry out one prediction at a time with 
						no chance to save the data locally. This means it wouldn't be very practical in practice.

					<p>
						After carefully comparing our three prototypes with our HCI knowledge gained and evaluating each of them individually, we came up with a final design. 
						We decided to use Prototype 2 as our base due the use of the UCL Indigo theme and the overview page. To make sure our final design met all the user and
						client needs, we went through each requirement individually to ensure they were accounted for.
					</p>
					<p>
						From our Must Have and Should Have requirements, all of these tasks have been fulfilled. This is because all the key features are able to be carried out 
						by the user. The user can log in and upload a scan which is then processed on the server side. The results are then returned to the user in a easy to 
						understand format. The user's scans are saved on the server and can also be saved locally.

							</tr>
						</table>
					</p>
					<p>
						The final design contains no unnecessary features and is very easy to use due to taking into account software bloat consequences. With usability being 
						a primary goal for the application we made adjustments for each of the negative issues discussed previously in the Prototypes section. This meant little 
						problems that affect the user's experience like being able to cancel a scan were accounted for.

						Brain Scan Processing
                    </p>
					<p>
						Over the course of the first term, we have completed the scripting of automating several processes with regards to the brain scans. When a user sends the 
						scans shown in the above user interface, what they are sending are the raw images of the brain produced from the fMRI scan. These then need to be converted 
						into a usable format. After this there needs to be a generation of a spreadsheet which indicates percentage damage of specified brain regions that are then 
						compared with previous brain scans in a database. There are several more steps which we plan to go over and complete in the second half of this project. This 
						would then result in the completion of the back-end of our application where the predictions for brain scans are generated automatically. The tasks we have 
						already completed are described below:
					</p>
					<h4>
						Raw Image Conversion
					</h4>
					<p>
						This procedure consisted of processing a number of raw images from an fMRI brain scan into a usable, normalised overview with damaged regions indicated. For 
						this task, the clients already had a system in place for completing the procedure. However it consisted of a large number of tedious steps which took place 
						in MATLAB through SPM. This procedure took upwards of 20 minutes for each patient's scan. We have managed to automate these processes through scripts written 
						in MATLAB that can now complete the task in around five minutes, depending on the processor speed. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Automatic Generation of Spreadsheet
					</h4>
					<p>
						For the automatic generation of the spreadsheet, we received a GUI version of a program created for this procedure from our clients. We came to a conclusion that 
						it was pointless to reinvent the wheel and we came up with a way of calling call-back functions of the buttons with externally provided parameters such as 
						patients' brain scans, output file location, among others. In order to access the GUI itself from an external script we had to change a few parameters of the 
						interface, so that its handles would be visible externally. Then we had to analyse the code and find exactly which handles were required for this procedure and 
						which values they should have. After doing so we proceeded with our script that is eventually going to be the part of the final application. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Our code for the above processes can be found in our GitHub repository. It includes the scripts we produced as well as the code our clients gave us to use for our 
						tasks.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Build Automation
                    </p>
					<p>
						Due to the fact we will be deploying to a server, we have some experience due to our first scenario week. In terms of configuring the server for use, we 
						will have to wait for the client to confirm what operating system they want to use. If it is Linux based then a bash script can be used to automate 
						installation of all of the necessary dependencies through the relevant package manager. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The next stage is setting up Git with a bash script which is is as simple as using a make directory command to create a directory in the correct place. Then 
						we shall be using Git clone to clone the repository. A small amount of server configuration will probably be needed too.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to automate updates to the software, we can script in  Git Hooks, which automatically detects if any commits have been pushed up to the repository. 
						This thus links the hook to a Git pull command which means that the files are then updated automatically on the server.

					<p>
						Through our research and knowledge gained through COMP204P, we have a strong understanding of our plans for the second term. There are two major parts to 
						the solution for our initial problem statement. We shall build a front-end and back-end for our application.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Front-End
                    </p>
					<p>
						For the front-end, we have decided to build our application as a website so that it is accessible to any computer that has a web browser without the need
						to install anything extra. The web app shall be built in HTML and with the use of an additional framework, Django. Multiple prototypes were built with a 
						final design agreed upon which means we simply need to program our chosen design. All the features have also been agreed upon in our MoSCoW style 
						requirements, with an emphasis being placed on ease of access.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Back-End
                    </p>
					<p>
						For the back-end, the primary aim is to ensure everything is automated such that no manual adjustments are needed for a prediction to be made. There 
						are various processes that the raw images from the fMRI scan need to go through. Some of these processes occur in MATLAB with some automation already 
						completed by scripts also written in MATLAB. This decision has proved advantageous as it is possible to integrate the MATLAB scripts with the Django 
						framework without much difficulty.
					<p class="lead">
						Potential Future Plans
                    </p>
					<p>
						There are some goals which are not expected to be met during the course of the project but could prove useful to add in the future. These are:
						<li>Present a picture or video of the brain scan image in the results page</li>
						<li>Produce a desktop application to allow offline usage of the prediction service</li>
						<li>Adapt the whole process to allow scans from different types of MRI scanners</li>

						During the initial stages of the development of the application we have recognised the importance of testing individual parts of the code. 
						Processing patients’ brain scans take multiple steps and even if one of them fails, the whole result is going to be wrong. This could possibly 
						lead to some dangerous consequences for the patient such as getting unnecessary treatment. Therefore each produced part of the code is tested 
						whenever a change is performed.
					</p>
					<p>
						The testing for the two main elements of our program will have an obvious split. For the front end we will be using a combination of HTML and CSS, 
						with Django as a framework, which will be making calls to the back end. These will be into MATLAB and also for integrating with the existing PLORAS 
						database held in SQL format. As we can see there is a lot of integration between different languages and frameworks so it makes sense to test 
						functionality of each of these in a modular fashion. Although automated testing is ideal, it is an outright fact that a certain of level of human 
						involvement will be required in the testing of the brain scan manipulating scripts ran within MATLAB.
					</p>
					<p>
						For testing MATLAB scripts, we have used the integrated unit tests. However, they could not be used everywhere and could not be as automated 
						as we would have wished for. This is because the scripts take actual brain scans as inputs that cannot be randomly generated, so our number of 
						possible inputs is limited. Therefore our testing consisted of manually pre-generating with the same method our client used. This was done for 
						all of the required steps using data provided by our client. Then after each code change, a script runs the given step and the produced image 
						is compared to the pre-generated one. If it differs even by the slightest bit, the code would be worked on until the image was right. 
					</p>
					<p>
						With regards to the testing of the database, we will need to output to a test database in order to test our system. This is due to the fact that we 
						aren’t going to have access to the PLORAS live database because of patient confidentiality.
					</p>
					<p>
						As we will be producing the front end for the server that is going to run the MATLAB scripts, we plan on using Django’s unit tests as 
						in this case we will be able to use some randomised data in order to achieve higher test coverage. This is because Django actually supports 
						automated testing fairly well out of the box. Python from which Django is built upon has a built in unit test module which can be used for this purpose.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of our key considerations is security due to the data that we’re handling and processing. Therefore we will have to do a lot more web security 
						research and testing. An issue that we know of is JavaScript injection, also known as cross-server scripting. There are no doubt other security 
						considerations that we will need to acknowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
						By performing all of these tests we aim to achieve:
						<li>Fulfilment of the client’s requirements</li>
						<li>Capture and removal of bugs as soon as possible</li>
						<li>Increased stability of the application</li>
						<li>Ensuring client confidence in the final product</li>
						<li>Increased security of the application</li>
						<li>Greater range of available features</li>

					<p>
						While our system has primarily been developed to work with the scanning system in place at BUCNI (Birkbeck-UCL Centre for Neuroimaging), a Siemens Avanto MRI 
						scanner, it is possible for a number of other scanners to produce images that could be processed in a similar way.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first part to need altering would be the conversion of image slices into a 3-dimensional image; currently our system is checking for a specific format and 
						number of slices as per would be expected from a BUCNI scan. Any collaborating research centres would need to build a pipe that could take their images and 
						convert them to the format required for the proceeding stages. A good point for this would be at the .IMG stage if possible. The process is illustrated with 
						an arrow to show the ideal connector point.
					</p>
					<p>
						This would require adjustments from our side to allow the IMGs to be uploaded and directly processed from this point. There may also be a 
						requirement for certain parameters to be altered such as the contrast tolerance used for identifying lesions as different intensity scanners would produce 
						different levels of contrast.
					</p>
					<p>
						An alternative would be to perform self processing independently then submit the scores for the different lesion areas to allow the prediction to still be 
						made for a given patient. This data could also be useful in enhancing the accuracy of future predictions.
