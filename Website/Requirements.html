					<p>
						We initially met up with our clients to gain a general understanding of our role as Computer Scientists for the project. This allowed us to obtain a set 
						of initial project requirements which we have been able to build upon in more detail as we have progressed.
						<li>Create a user interface that will allow hospitals to upload brain scans</li>
						<li>Stream line the PLORAS team's current software so that scans can be read and predictions made automatically</li>
						<li>Summarise the predictions (using a look up table) in a meaningful medical report</li>
						<li>Allow the medical staff access to this medical report</li>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Gathering Requirements</h2>
					<p>
						To obtain a clear cut set of detailed project requirements, we had to work closely with the clients to take into consideration what they wanted in their 
						user interface as well as other aspects of the prediction service. 
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Performance & Capabilities
                    </p>
					<p>
						Our application is primarily focused on user experience and the back-end of the application. It is therefore crucial that it is as performance efficient as 
						possible. It is especially important as the back-end processes take several minutes to process and every improvement would significantly help the PLORAS 
						team in processing more patients and generating recovery predictions for them. As for the operational capabilities of the system, the application has got to 
						be stable, as any crash or unpredicted flow of the program might result in the final result being wrong and therefore producing inaccurate  predictions for 
						a patient. However, we currently are not sure of the final capabilities of the system as we have not yet seen the machine our application is going to run on 
						and in some aspects we can only speculate.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also produced some Use Cases to better understand the system's behaviour as it responds to requests from a user. 
					</p>

						<li>Client interviews</li>
						<li>Use cases</li>
						<li>HCI analysis</li>
						<li>UI prototyping</li>
						These have also been continuously updated over the course of the second term as we steadily built our application. New needs came up and some requirements 
						were no longer needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						The requirements are set out in the MoSCoW style format where they are ordered in order of priority. We shall aim to get the more important Must Have and 
						Should Have requirements completed by the end of the project with the less important requirements held with a lesser priority.
