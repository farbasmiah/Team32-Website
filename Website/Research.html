                    <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>
					<p>
						Upon meeting with our client initially, we discovered that a certain amount of our work was inflexible as it relied on third party programs. We needed to 
						use MATLAB and SPM, a specialist neuroscience tool kit for MATLAB. We thus needed to learn more about the following below: 
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						MATLAB, SPM and ALI
                    </p>
					<p>
						As mentioned above, a significant part of our project relies on third party scripts and toolboxes. The whole idea of our project is to create a way for 
						hospital staff to send and process their patient’s scans in order to predict their chances of speech recovery. Currently the processing is done manually 
						by the PLORAS team by inserting data into some specialized MATLAB scripts which are part of ALI (Automatic Lesion Identification) which is an additional 
						toolbox to the SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) toolbox. The whole processing has several sub-steps with different required data and each of them 
						requires results from previous steps.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the above in mind, there was still a need to produce a front end of some sorts to fetch 
						the location of the scan files as well as select an output directory for the script outputs. In order to do this, we established two approaches. At first 
						our thinking was to produce some sort of cross-platform application but this later evolved to a web application running MATLAB on a server. This section 
						documents our research into these two areas:
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Cross-Platform Desktop Application
                    </p>
					<h4>
						Java
					</h4>
					<p>
						One language that is well known for its cross platform versatility, with one of the original intentions of it being to be a true "write once, run anywhere" 
						language, Java is used on a massive range of devices and is one of the widest used languages around. The advantage of Java is that it only needs writing 
						once and there is no extra time compiling for each OS. The disadvantage is that it relies on the user’s machine having a version of the Java Virtual Machine 
						installed on it, which in the case of hospitals cannot be guaranteed and would require an extra step for them in terms of preparing the software for use.
					</p>
					<h4>
						C++
					</h4>
					<p>
						Another potential option is to use C++, offering a much lower level of memory access and management than Java. This also presents a hazard in terms of 
						ensuring the program remains memory leak free. C++ is used in a range of contexts from office applications to operating systems. The advantage compared to 
						Java is obviously that it does not require prior installation of anything. The difficulty is that it needs compiling for each OS and architecture. It also 
						needs a GUI for each OS although this can be overcome by using a cross platform GUI kit such as wxWidgets.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Web Application
					</p>
					<p>
						The advantage to a web application is that because it is run on a server it requires no installation on the user’s machine. Therefore it is the ultimate in 
						terms of cross-platform compatibility. Although, the server does needs to have a compatible version of the code. For our application, it will also be 
						necessary to consider the security of the app due to the fact that it deals with patient data (although it is somewhat anonymised.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Django
					</h4>
					<p>
						Django is a high level web framework based on the popular language Python, well known for its principle of “don’t repeat yourself”. Having researched, we 
						discovered that other web apps have been built using Django, making calls to MATLAB which is exactly what we need to do for our project.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Rails
					</h4>
					<p>
						Rails is another web framework based on the language Ruby. Once again it relies on the “don’t repeat yourself” ideology. Although our team have some 
						experience with this framework, we weren’t sure about how we would go about making the calls to MATLAB. Fortunately, this is something that other people 
						have done before and documented.

                    <!-- clearfix makes it so elements are not side by side -->
                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Decisions</h2>
					<p>
						We had to make major decisions for the front-end which consists of the user interface and also the back-end which would be the server side of things. Our 
						decisions can be seen below with usability and ease of production being the key drivers in leading to the conclusions that were made.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Back-End
                    </p>
					<p>
						If we were to develop those scripts ourselves from scratch, we would almost surely have failed as besides the extensive computing knowledge, we would have 
						to learn a significant chunk of neurobiology on how the brain works, what the purposes of its given parts are and so on. Therefore, the obvious and only 
						choice was to automate the existing scripts and so MATLAB, SPM and ALI had to be included in our project as they were to be the core of the project. The 
						next step we had taken in our research consisted of learning which functions from the toolboxes are used in processing patients’ scans, how they work and 
						what data they require and produce. 
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Front-End
                    </p>
					<p>
						Ultimately our findings have led us to believe that a web based application would be the superior solution with either Django or Rails being very much 
						acceptable development platforms. This is due solely to the superior cross-platform abilities and lack of installation requirements. For a C++ or Java 						
						application, it would be a bigger hassle for the hospital to have to install the required application as well as any add ons that are required to make 
						it work for every single computer. This therefore showed that a web based application would be the least tedious method for uploading scans and retrieving 
						the results.

					<p>
						In order for this project to be successful, we need to make sure that the users are not hindered by using the application in any way but instead are able 
						to navigate through each page with ease. This has been particularly emphasised by the clients with a primary goal being ease of use. Due to this, it 
						would be wise for us to analyse the human computer interaction with an expected target user. In doing so, we would be able to see how our current plan 
						works as well as on how we could improve the usability. 
					</p>
					<p>
						A key difference in this project compared to others is that the application to be designed has never been done before so we were unable to carry out a 
						thorough competitor analysis. This therefore meant it was all the more important to interview a potential user to understand their key needs. 
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Persona
                    </p>
					<p>
						In order for us to understand the user needs, we carried out a user interview with a single persona created. As our application is only targeted at hospital 
						workers, multiple personas are not needed. 	
					</p>
					<img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="./Images/persona.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">
					 <p>
						User: 
					 </p>
					 <p>
						A medical doctor who is neutral towards new technology.
					 </p>
					<p>
						Background: 
					</p>
					<p>
						A 34 year old neurologist in London. He enjoys interacting with patients, trying to build up strong relationships with everyone he meets. Throughout his day, 
						he jots down little notes for himself on his notepad that he keeps with him constantly. He considers himself quite traditional in the way he prefers pen and 
						paper over the more modern methods of keeping track of notes. The hospital he works at has slowly introduced more computer dependant software that he is now 
						required to use multiple times a day. He isn't opposed to the new methods, sometimes finds new applications beneficial if they have a simple, responsive design. 
						However, he does find them annoyingly tedious at times. Sometimes he has no idea on how to use a specific software due to so many different options to pick from 
						for the simplest of tasks, taking time from his day and that of the IT support staff. Even the computer he uses on daily basis annoys him constantly by freezing 
						at inconvenient times. This means that he has to restart his computer and begin fresh on his recent tasks.

					<p class="lead">
						HCI Considerations
                    </p>
					<p>
						Although our client has specifically requested a basic user interface, there are still considerations we can make to improve usability. For example, the 
						addition of unnecessary features, or the layout of the page can be of hindrance to the usability of the system. Below is a documentation of some bits and 
						pieces we have discovered should help in this aspect:
					</p>
					<h4>
						Buttons
					</h4>
					<p>
						Buttons are used widely throughout web design, and there is no doubt that almost everybody can relate to the situation of wasting extended periods of time 
						hunting for subtle buttons. That situation is undoubtedly what we wish to avoid. What we need to do is provide users with clearly labelled, well coloured 
						buttons that are large enough to easily click. Not only this, but they should give the user some idea of where the button will lead them to, if it does 
						lead them away from the current page.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Navigation Bar
					</h4>
					<p>
						Our client has requested that the system use the UCL Indigo theme. The main feature from which that we will use is the navigation bar at the top of the page. 
						This gives us some opportunities, it shows a directory tree of pages above the current one which we may wish to adapt to show different stages of submission 
						requirements for patient processing. For example, it could show Patient Details >> Upload Pictures >> Patient Confirmation if you are on the third stage of 
						submitting a scan for analysis. See below for an example of it in use on the PLORAS website.

						Form Layout
					</h4>
					<p>
						While it may seem something fairly obvious and a minuscule task, creating an effective form requires thought. In our case, we know precisely what level our 
						users will be at and what will need further explanation. The main way of communicating what a given option (such as a text field or drop down menu) is for 
						is using labels. Clever forms combine the title with the description succinctly by making use of bold text or italics. We need to keep the design between 
						pages consistent, and also consider using the least aggressive wording possible because we want the form to be more like an interview than an interrogation.
						Other ideas include grouping options together with white space in the correct places, and placing input boxes below the box description, as this speeds up 
						the reading process.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another feature which is useful is separating primary and secondary actions. For example having save and submit buttons or back and cancel buttons, in order 
						to allow the user to step forwards or back the amount that they require.
					</p>
					<p>
						Validation of fields will be important as it allows us to check information before it is pushed to the database. It should be kept as minimal as required 
						and should not restrict users where possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Help can be provided in many ways. A common way is a small question mark icon, or similar, that when hovered over or clicked displays a pop-up text box 
						further explaining the input required. This would be the preferred method for us as it is widely used and also intuitive.
